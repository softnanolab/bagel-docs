title: "GlobularEnergy"
description: "Energy proportional to the moment of inertia of the structure around its centroid. This energy is minimized when the atoms belonging to a structure have the lowest possible distance from the centre, and, due to excluded volume effects that prevent collapse to a single point, helps forcing structures to be as close as possible to a spherically distributed cloud of points."

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="oracle" type="Oracle" required>
  The oracle to use for the energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="residues" type="list[Residue] | None" default="None">
  Which residues to include in the calculation. Considers all residues by default.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="inheritable" type="bool" default="True">
  If a new residue is added next to a residue included in this energy term, this dictates whether that new residue could then be added to this energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="weight" type="float" default="1.0">
  The weight of the energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="str | None" default="None">
  Optional name to append to the energy term name.
</ResponseField>

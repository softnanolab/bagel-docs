## Parameters

<ResponseField name="oracle" type="FoldingOracle" required>
  The oracle to use for the energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="residues" type="list[list[Residue]]" required>
  Which residues to include in the first and second group.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pae_cutoff" type="float" default="12.0">
  The cutoff value for the PAE, in Angstroms, below which the interaction is considered "local".
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="intensive" type="bool" default="True">
  If True, the LIS is averaged over the number of residue pairs, otherwise it's an extensive sum.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="inheritable" type="bool" default="True">
  If a new residue is added next to a residue included in this energy term, this dictates whether that new residue could then be added to this energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="weight" type="float" default="1.0">
  The weight of the energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="str | None" default="None">
  Optional name to append to the energy term name.
</ResponseField>

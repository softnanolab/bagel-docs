title: "SecondaryStructureEnergy"
description: "Energy that drives the secondary structure of the selected residues to a given type. Calculated by finding the fraction of selected residues with the wrong secondary structure. Secondary structure types include alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and coil."
---

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="oracle" type="Oracle" required>
  The oracle to use for the energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="residues" type="list[Residue]" required>
  Which residues to include in the calculation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="target_secondary_structure" type="str" required>
  Which secondary structure type to drive towards. Options are 'alpha-helix', 'beta-sheet', or 'coil'.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="inheritable" type="bool" default="True">
  If a new residue is added next to a residue included in this energy term, this dictates whether that new residue could then be added to this energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="weight" type="float" default="1.0">
  The weight of the energy term.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="str | None" default="None">
  Optional name to append to the energy term name.
</ResponseField>
